Layout in Bootstrap is controlled using the grid system. The Bootstrap grid has
twelve columns.

There are three main layout components in dash-bootstrap-components: Container,
Row, and Col.

The layout of your app should be built as a series of rows of columns.

We set md=4 indicating that on a 'medium' sized or larger screen each column
should take up a third of the width. Since we don't specify behaviour on
smallersize screens Bootstrap will allow the rows to wrap so as not to squash
the content.
